#' Frequency or Percentage bar-charts of Grades or Responses.
#' 
#' @description fnBarChart creates Frequency or Percentage bar-charts of Grades or Responses (and select characteristics such as Gender, Ethnicity, and Disability). It is designed to require only minimal input, but will request additional arguments if it cannot distinguish between two schemes (e.g. UBSE and USE when there are no B grades in Data).
#' 
#' fnBarChart has also been designed to be as autonomous as possible, and can handle most variations in Data values, e.g. c("U","b","Satisfactory","E","excellent","S") will still be recognised as using a UBSE scheme, and the plot will relabel the values accordingly.
#' 
#' The output from fnBarChart is a ggplot object which can then be saved or customised as needed.  
#' 
#' See Examples for more details.
#' 
#' @usage fnBarChart(Data, Type, Force.Scheme) 
#' 
#' @param Data Data should be a vector of values representing grades or responses, e.g. c("U","B","S","S","E") or Data.All$Grades.
#' 
#' Factors will be coerced into suitable formats, data frames and lists will return a prompt to check the format.
#' 
#' FnBarChart can handle combinations of capitalisation, alphanumeric or numeric abbreviations, and full-text labels for UBSE, USE, UBS, CIDK, CNINC, PFE, and PF schemes.
#' 
#' The function can also handle selected themes outside of those related to responses and grades, though scheme detection is more restricted and less reliable. e.g. Gender, Ethnicity (will be reduced to "White"/"Asian"/"Other"), and Disability (will be reduced to "No Known Disability"/"Specific Learning Difficulty"/"Other Disability").
#' @param Type Type can be set to "Frequency" or "Percentage", and determines the y-axis scale. Type="Frequency" plots counts of each value in Data, whereas Type="Percentage" plots the percentage of each value in Data.
#' 
#' fnBarChart can handle variations on "Frequency" and "Percentage" (within reason), e.g. "Perc" or "f"
#' @param Force.Scheme Force.Scheme is an optional argument that can take the values "USE", "UBS", "PF", "CIDK", and "CNINC". It is requested when the function cannot determine a single scheme from the values in Data. For example, if Data consists of a string of "C" values, the function will ask the user to specify Force.Scheme="CIDK" or Force.Scheme="CNINC", or if Data only contains U, S, and E grades (or variations), it will ask the user specify Force.Scheme="USE" if the scheme should be USE rather than UBSE.
#' 
#' These pieces of additional information allow the correct handling of USE, UBS, and PF schemes, and C-only Data.
#' 
#' Force.Scheme has no effect when a scheme can be determined or on totally unknown themes (unknown as opposed to indeterminate).
#' 
#'  @note DZ260417: Added a fix for Type being converted to a factor after the reference table being used to handle abbreviated type names. This seems to work, but it needs checking with respect to different classes of Type object and associated error messages.

# Function designed to plot grade and response frequencies, counts, and percentages.

# Inputs
#
# Data      Single vector containing all data points; e.g. c("U", "S", "S", "B", "E") or Data.All$Grades
#           Can be of any data type.
#           Can handle any combination of abbreviations and/or full-text labels
#           (Within reason; add any unusual ones to Data.Scheme)
#
# Type      Character string, specifying whether the plot should display is "Frequency" or "Percentage"
#           Can handle some abbreviations and variations of these two terms.
